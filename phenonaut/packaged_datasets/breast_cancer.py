    """Breast Cancer Dataset from scikit-learn

        This PackagedDataset provides the Breast Cancer dataset from
        scikit-learn. This is also known as the Breast cancer Wisconsin
        (diagnostic) dataset.
        See the scikit-learn user guide for more information:
        https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#breast-cancer-dataset
        Original dataset information available at:
        https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
        
        Contains 569 unique samples breast cancer fine needle aspirates, each
        with 30 features, and one target of 0 or 1, denoting benign or
        malignant respectively.

        Parameters
        ----------
        root : Union[Path, str]
            Local directory containing the prepared dataset. If the dataset is
            not found here and the argument download=True is not given, then an
            error is raised. If download=True and the processed dataset is
            absent, then it is downloaded the directory pointed at by the
            'raw_data' argument detailed below. If raw_data_dir is a
            non-absolute path, such as a single directory,
            then it is created as a subdirectory of this root directory.
        download : bool, optional
            If true and the processed dataset is not found in the root
            directory, then the dataset is downloaded and processed.
            By default False.
        raw_data_dir : Optional[Union[Path, str]], optional
            If downloading and preparing the dataset, then a directory for the
            raw data may be specified. If a non-absolute location is given,
            then it is created in a subdirectory of the root directory
            specified as the first argument. Absolute paths may be used to
            place raw datafiles and intermediates in another location, such as
            scratch disks etc, by default Path("raw_data").
