class PackagedDataset(ABC):
    """PackagedDataset base class for all downloaded Datasets

    Inherited by Phenonaut classes which supply public datasets in the same
    way that pytorch allows easy access to MNIST and FashionMNIST etc,
    Phenonaut offers classes which download and preprocess datasets like
    TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Connectivity Map), which may
    include many different 'views' or omics-based measurements of the
    underlying cells.

    Inheriting from this class allows easy access to commonly used functions
    for checking datasets exist in directories and downloading them if not,
    in addition to more small helpful functions. Inheriting grants the
    following:

    * Getters and setters for root and raw_data_dir, properly handling the expected location of dataset files, listing available Phenonaut Dataset objects via the .keys() or ds_keys() methods, listing supporting dataframes via the df_keys() methods.
    * download and batch_download functions which simplify the download of remote public datasets.
    * processed_dataset_exists and raw_dataset_exists, which check for the presence of the processed dataset and the raw dataset, respectively.

    Inheriting classes should do the following:

    * Call super().__init__() on initialisation
    * Check if they find a saved/processed version of the packaged dataset. The CMAP and TCGA classes which inherit from this PackagedDataset process and save the datasets in an h5 file. This is optional, and any store may be used.
    * If it does not exist, download the data storing it in .raw_data_dir, process the data and store in a convenient format.
    * Register the available Phenonaut Datasets associated with this PackagedDataset.  By convention, the default/main dataset should be named 'ds'. Registration is completed by calling self.register_ds_key('ds_name'). Available Phenonaut Datasets are available by calling self.keys(), or self.ds_keys(). Phenonaut datasets may be accessed by calling get_ds, or with the ['ds_name'] notation on the PackagedDataset instance.
    * Register the available supporting dataframes associated with this PackagedDataset. Supporting dataframe names can be listed by calling df_keys() and accessed by calling get_df('df_name').
    * Classes should provide their own get_df and get_ds methods. This is enforced by this base class specifying required methods to be present through inheritance of the AbstractBaseClass.

    Parameters
    ----------
    root : Union[Path, str]
        Root directory for the dataset. The root directory should contain
        processed files, usable by Phenonaut, this means that the data has
        been downloaded and usually transformed in some manner prior to
        being put here. By convention, processed files will be put into
        this directory, but there will exist a subdirectory called
        "raw_data", within which downloaded files (possibly compressed)
        will be placed prior to preprocessing.
    raw_data_dir : Optional[Union[Path, str]], optional
        Directory in which the raw, downloaded files should be saved, also
        the location of intermediate files generated in the processing step.
        By convention, this directory lies within the root directory and has
        the default name "raw_data". It can be an absolute path in a
        different directory or filesystem by setting
        raw_data_dir_relative_to_root argument to False.
        By default Path("raw_data").
    raw_data_dir_relative_to_root : bool, optional
        As described for the raw_data_dir argument, by the "raw_data"
        directory is usually within the root directory for the dataset.
        If this argument is True, then the full path of the raw_data_dir is
        generated with root as the parent directory.  If this value is
        False, then it is taken to be an absolute path, possibly existing
        on another filesystem. By default True.

        """Register a Phenonaut Dataset key with the PackagedDataset

        Packaged datasets may contain or have access to multiple pd.DataFrames
        from which Phenonaut Datasets can be created. These Datasets contain not
        only the pd.DataFrame containing data, but also features and additional
        metadata such as history and origin. The main Phenonaut Dataset should
        be called, by convention "ds" and additional Phenonaut Datasets given a
        descriptive name. In the case of the CMAP dataset, the main DataSet (ds)
        contains the L1000 values, feature and metadata. Supporting dataframes
        are accessible using the .get_df("name") method and contain information
        on things like the perturbation type, compound information, etc. Keys
        are typically the same as their HDF5 store key values, although this is
        up to the specific PackagedDataset implementation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : Union[str, List[str]]
            Short string which may be used to access the pd.DataFrame.
            When given, to the function, the name will be registered. After
            which the inheriting class should allow access to a Phenonaut
            Dataset via the __getitem__ method, allowing access to the
            Phenonaut Dataset via pdf['ds'].
