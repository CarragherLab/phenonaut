    Parameters
    ----------

        Multidimensional point, can be a simple list of [x,y,z], or a 2d M*N
        list where M are multiple points to be individually measured of N
        features and returning an array of measurmenents for each point.
    cloud : Union[List[List[float]], np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame]
        2D M*N array-like set of M points, with N features from which the
        underlying target distribution will be measured.
    covariance_estimator : Optional[object], optional
        Instantiated object with fit and mahalanobis methods used for covariance
        estimation. MinCovDet is used by default from sklearn.covariance.
        Another option is sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance().
