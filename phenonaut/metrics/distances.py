    The Mahalanobis distance calculation is particularly sensitive to outliers,
    which results in large changes in covariance matrix calculation. For this
    reason, robust covarience estimators may be suppplied to the method. Whilst
    a common recomendation is to calculate the sqrt of the Mahalanobis distance,
    this is an approximation to euclidean space, only correct when the covariance
    matrix is an identity matrix. As Phenonaut is concerned on operating on high
    dimensional space which very likely has covariences present, the returned
    distance is not square rooted, returning D2 as noted.

    Optionally, the p-value for the point or points belonging to the cloud can
    be returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    point : Union[List[float],np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame]
        Multidimensional point, can be a simple list of features, or a 2d M*N
        list where M are multiple points to be individually measured of N
        features and returning an array of measurmenents for each point.
    cloud : Union[List[List[float]], np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame]
        2D M*N array-like set of M points, with N features from which the
        underlying target distribution will be measured.
    pvals : bool
        If True, then p-value for the point (or points) belonging to cloud is returned.
        This is calculated using Chi2 and degrees of freedom calculated as
        N-1, where N is the number of features/dimensions. If point was one
        dimensional, then a single floating point value is returned. If it is 2D
        (MxN matrix), then an array of length M is returned. By default, False.
    covariance : Optional[Union[np.ndarray, EmpiricalCovariance]], optional
        If none, then the covariance matrix is calculated using scikit's
        EmpiricalCovariance. This is fairly robust to outliers, and much more robust
        than the standard approach to calculating a covariance matrix (using numpy's
        np.cov method. Robust estimators may be used by passing in an instantiated
        object which a subclass of EmpiracalCovariance (like
        sklearn.covariance.MinCovDet or EmpiricalCovariance itself). If None, then
        numpy's cov method is used (sensitive to outliers). By default EmpiracalCovariance().

    Returns
    -------
    [np.ndarray, float]
        Array (if point is 2D) of distances. If 1D, then single float value is
        returned indicating the Mahalanobis distance of the point to the
        cloud.
