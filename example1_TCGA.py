        Output directory for the results of phenonaut.predict.profile.

        The location of the TCGA dataset if already downloaded, otherwise, the destination location.
    n_optuna_trials : int
        Number of optuna_trials to run for each predictor and each view, by default 20.
    run_predictors : bool, optional
        If True, then run all predictors, by default True.
    optuna_merge_folds : bool, optional
        By default, every fold of the train-validation split is optimised by optuna for a predictor&view pair.
        If optuna_merge_folds is true, then the average validation score of each fold is passed as the result
        to optuna, optimising models across all folds. , by default False.
